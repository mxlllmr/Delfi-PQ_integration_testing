# Delfi-PQ - Integration testing

## Purpose

Delfi-PQ belongs to the new type of miniaturized satellites, namely PocketQube satellites, which exhibit certain advantages over the widely used CubeSats. Due to their smaller size, PocketQubes bring a decrease in total cost and development time. The main objective of Delfi-PQ is to test the application of a PocketQube satellite for future missions since it is expected that the reduced development cycle will allow a comparably higher launch frequency, increasing flight experience and reliability of the system.

To ensure that the respective subsystems are operational, the integration of the Delfi-PQ system must be tested. While in space, the functionality of a subsystem cannot be observed directly and positive feedback from the subsystem itself does not guarantee a faultless execution of the specified task. Additionally, the subsystem hardware itself is not able to detect if the execution was in fact successful. Hence, it is necessary to deploy verification through external hardware if the command given to the subsystem was effectively executed.

This project will focus on the design and implementation of a solution for verifying the successful execution of a command given to the subsystem. In particular, the verification of the LED command to the LaunchPad (Texas Instruments) is demonstrated via external hardware (Arduino Mega). Thereafter, the same logic is applied in order the verify the power bus command to the ADB of Delfi-PQ. The provided software is intended to be modified easily in order to adapt the integration testing to different subsystems of the Delfi-PQ.

- **EGSE software**: Remaining files in the folder "PQ9EGSE-master"

## Background

### Continuous integration

Continuous intergration is a software development approach where members of a team or a group of people integrate code changes into shared repositories. Instead of adapting major alterations over a greater period of time minor changes are implemented more frequently, and often on a daily basis. After the alterations are merged to the repository the integration is verified immediately by built and unit tests to guarantee the code's functionality and to detect possible emerging integration problems. The advantage of continuous integration is that integration errors are discovered very early, are identified and located more easily, and hence can be eradicated immediately which leads to an overall reduction in intergration problems and a decrease in debugging time, followed by an overall improvement of the software's quality combined with the benefit of shorter time periods between verified software updates. Likewise due to the continuous integration process this project kept adapting to different design demands from where the multiple remotely different variations of python scrips within this repository originate and henceforth the user is asked to integrate favored changes accordingly [[1]](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/), [[2]](https://nevercode.io/blog/what-is-continuous-integration-and-how-to-benefit-from-it/).

### Integration testing

Integration testing follows unit testing. Here, the units are combined and tested as a whole. Hence, possible design flaws can be exposed and unforeseen faults between the integrated units can be detected. With this, in this project the several subsystems will be combined and tested in group, where an external board (Arduino) checks the change in a state of a Delfi-PQ subsystem.

## Design

The overall purpose of this project is to do integration testing of the Delfi-PQ subsystems. To do so, first the interaction between the PC and a SimpleLinkâ„¢ MSP432P401R LaunchPad, which emulates the on-board software, is tested. This is done by plugging an Arduino to the PC and connect one of its GPIO ports to the LaunchPad. This way the commands are tested both with the subsystem feedback (either by printing it in the terminal or by using the EGSE software) and with the external hardware feedback.

### Arduino 

The Arduino script is the simplest one. It updates every second in the Serial Monitor the value that is read in the GPIO that is connected to the LaunchPad. The Serial Monitor is later interpreted by the python scripts, which in their turn use such values.

#### Arduino block diagram

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50111548/59805326-d0b08800-92a5-11e9-8e63-e66b61d4de22.jpg" width="700"/>

### Python

The script shown below is more complex and requires a more detailed analysis. This is exposed right after it.

The design of this script had to take into account the way that an Arduino can communicate with Python and the way the communications with the LaunchPad are structured. The former requires printing in the board's Serial Monitor, which can be later read by the script. This reading has to be done in a thread, that constantly updates what was just printed, and another thread that systematically checks (within a time frame, with the function ```time.sleep()```) the pin value.

The latter communication is done by sending messages in a structured way to the board, which is emulating, through a local host, the Delfi-PQ software. The feedback is received and has to be interpreted. This also requires a thread that will be used to get the subsystem feedback and a later function that prints what was received.

#### Python block diagrams


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50111548/60195107-617bec00-97ef-11e9-8da4-78b836ade043.jpg"/>

After variables initialization and defining the ```pq_class``` with the local host settings and the functions from ```pq_comms.py``` and ```pq_module.py``` (as it can be seen in the source code), the script starts by printing a message to the user in ```introduction``` (0). After this, the user is asked to choose the Arduino port (1). If the input is incorrect, the user is required to retry. Only after a ```0``` or a ```1``` is read from the board 3 times, the program proceeds (to a valid port, the program tries to get a response 1000000 times before printing a 'try again' message).

If this connection is successful, the first thread is initialised (T1). This allows getting the data from the LaunchPad. This is invoked before ```initialization``` (2) because this function tries to get a response from the LaunchPad in order to establish a successful connection. If 10 *packets* are read from the *ping* command to *DEBUG* (successfully, each one 1 second after the prior), the main program proceeds. To note that if one of this connections is not established (Arduino or LaunchPad), the only way to exit is with ```CTRL+C```, which the script is ready to receive, outputting an 'Exit.' message with no errors. This was opted for because it also was implemented in the EGSE software when it did not connect properly. In this case, the user has to kill the program and run it again to try to establish a connection.

Hereafter, T2, T3 and T4 threads, as well as the ```signal.signal```, are initialized. All of the threads only run if the *working* flag is *True*. The signal detects if ```CTRL+C``` was pressed. In case that happened, the *working* flag becomes *False* and the program begins to terminate.

The ```send_packets``` thread (T2) invokes the ```user_input``` function. This function protects the program against any other input that is not a  ```0``` or a ```1```  (disregarding the exit command). In case the input is a valid one, the variable *user* is changed accordingly. As the input function stalls the thread, an extra verification of the *working* flag after the function was called, is required (which also explains the final ```ENTER``` command, which will be shown in the 'How to use' section). Then, the package is sent referring to the corresponding command in ```pq_comms.py``` (```ledON()``` or ```ledOFF()```) and the function calls ```pq_class.get_packets()```. As the T1 is already running, ```pq_class.get_data()``` was already invoked and the *packets* variable can be updated. If there is feedback, it is sent to function number 4, which prints a message with the source of the former. The Arduino feedback is immediately analised, by calling the function ```check(0)```, where ```0``` allows the function to break out after one check.

The ```receiving``` thread (T3) constantly updates what is printed in the Serial monitor of the Arduino. If a new line is detected, the buffer is split and saved in the variable *lines*. The variable *last_received* (which is the useful variable) gets the 2nd to last line. Then, the buffer is updated. This allows reading at least the last two lines, which can ensure that the Arduino state was updated.

Finally, thread T4, ```check```, prints on the screen the Arduino's feedback. If this one differs from the user input and/or the subsystem feedback, then an error message is saved in a log file. After this, the *user* variable (last user input) is refreshed to what is read by the Arduino, which prevents repeated errors saved in the log file. This thread also serves as a function to immediately check the Arduino feedback after an input. For this, the *wait_time* value should be ```0```. Else, the function invokes the ```time.sleep()``` with the *wait_time* as an input.

#### Adaptations for ```client_ADB.py``` and ```client_ADB_noUI.py```

In order to work with the ADB instead of the LaunchPad LED the before explained python script needs to be altered. The general structure of ```client_ADB.py``` and ```client_ADB_noUI.py``` is similar to the structure of ```client_LED.py``` and therefore including another flow chart is considered to be redundant.
In ```client_ADB.py``` a function asking the user to select the power bus number ```choose_bus_number()``` which shall be used is included and invoked right after ```initialization()``` and before T2, T3, and T4 are initialized. Within T2 the package is sent refering to the commands in ```pq_comms.py ``` appropriate for commanding the power bus (busON() and busOFF()). 
In ```client_ADB_noUI.py``` the Bus1Sw is turned on and off once and the Arduino feedback is checked immediately after the command is sent to the board. Following, T4 is omitted here, and ```check()``` is called right after the respective command is sent to the board within T2 (```send_package()```). Further, the user is not asked to choose a power bus, but Bus1Sw is predefined within the code (this may be adaped to a different bus in future projects).


## How to use
The required hard- and sorftware needed to execute the scripts found in this repository are listed below. Further, it is explained in detail how to use the scripts.

### Required hardware

In order to use the scripts provided in this repository, the user will need the following hardware items: 
- **SimpleLinkâ„¢ MSP432P401R LaunchPad**: Communicates with the python scripts and is simulating the Delfi-PQ subsystem
- **Arduino (UNO, MEGA, etc.)**: Used as the external hardware 
- **Wires**: To connect the LaunchPad and Arduino (2x female/male) and to connect the ADB to the Arduino (2x male/male)


### Software implementation
To run the following software, Arduino IDE, Python 2x and Java must be installed in the user's PC. This software must be cloned or forked there as well.

#### ```arduino_microsat.ino```

To run any of the python scripts, this code must be uploaded to the Arduino board connected to the PC. After checking the connection in Arduino IDE (by choosing the type of board in ```Tools->Board``` and the port in ```Tools->Port```), the user can upload the code to the board.

The Serial Monitor can be checked to verify its normal functioning. To help with this verification, the user can even uncomment the commented lines, as it is indicated in the source code. Nevertheless, to run the python scripts, it is crucial that:
- The Serial Monitor only receives 1 or 0;
- The Serial Monitor is not opened while running the scripts, such that a double access does not happen and interfere with the readings. It is advised that, after the verification of the functionality of this code, Arduino IDE is closed.

#### ```client_LED.py```

#####  Hardware setup
After connecting the Launchpad and the Arduino to the host computer, via USB ports, both need to be connected with each other as it is shown in the picture below. The GND (ground) pins of both boards need to be connected, as well as the pin P1.0 of the Launchpad's LED1 to the pin 7 on the Arduino board. If another pin instead of pin 7 is prefered, the respective pin number has to be modified in ```arduino_feedback.ino``` and the software needs to be compiled and uploaded to the Arduino (as explained above).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/60188387-7bd5ba00-982f-11e9-9107-cccfd8d4589e.jpg" width="400"/>

##### Running ```client_LED.py```

- Libraries needed: ```numpy```, ```serial```, ```threading```, ```sys```, ```time```, ```signal```, ```logging```, ```json```, ```socket```

- Files needed in repository: ```pq_module.py```, ```pq_comms.py```

- Commands: 
  - **0,1,2,... followed by ENTER**: Chooses the Arduino port
  - **0/1 followed by ENTER**: Sends a command to turn OFF/ON the LED
  - **CTRL+c followed by ENTER**: Exits the program
  
In order to run ```client_LED.py``` several steps need to be executed.
1. Run the EGSE software. This Java software should be in a local folder, and it runs by writing:
```
sudo java -jar target/PQ9EGSE-0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
in the terminal.

2. Choose the LaunchPad port in the EGSE software. this done by opening the browser in ```localhost:8080``` and choosing the port as in the picture below:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50111548/59802762-82e45180-929e-11e9-88b3-2b25fda94401.JPG" width="700"/>

By trial and error, the user can choose a port and verify if it is the correct one by pinging to the DEBUG and verifying a response in the DataLog.

3. Run the python script as:
```
sudo python client_LED.py localhost:8080
```
*NOTE: The last two commands (to run the EGSE and to run the python script) should be executed with the terminal running in the respective folders where the invoked files/paths exist. Else, simply replacing the files names by the full directory should suffice.*

4. After running ```client_LED.py```  a welcome message appears and an explanaition on how to utilise the program, including the commands which can be used:

```
#################################################################
Welcome to the LED detection software!
This application prints out every 10 seconds the Arduino feedback
The commands are: 1 to turn the LED ON, 0 to turn it OFF.
To exit the application press 'CTRL+C'
#################################################################
```
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59845077-c43b3680-935c-11e9-8ae2-82f78351f9d5.jpg"/>

Thereafter the user is asked to choose the Arduino port
```
Insert the arduino port (0,1,2,...): 
```
Here the port that connects the Arduino to the CPU has to be selected.

*NOTE: The Arduino board has to be connected in the format of ```/dev/ttyACM(...)```, else the program does not recognise it. In case the connection to the PC has a different designation, change line 267 of ```client_LED.py``` to the specific designation (for example, ```COM(...)```)*

If a wrong port was selected the user is notified and asked to try again.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59844789-fef09f00-935b-11e9-9907-858408ba19a2.jpg"/>

5. If the connection is established, the program will attempt to connect to the LaunchPad board. This is represented by a progress bar that looks like the following:
```
[###       ]
```
Each ```#``` represents a successful ping with the DEBUG subsystem of the board. 

6. Finally, the program is ready to take commands to turn ON and OFF the LED. Every 10 seconds (after the first user input) an update on the Arduino feedback is printed on the screen. Every time a user inputs 1/0 (+ENTER), the message that is sent to the board is printed. If there is feedback from the board, the following should appear:
```
Command received in DEBUG
```
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59845344-7246e080-935d-11e9-8a48-4ca8116ef08b.jpg"/>

Additionally, an immediate Arduino feedback check is performed. If the Arduino agrees with the subsystem feedback 
```
Arduino: The LED is ON.
```
is displayed if the LED is turned on and
```
Arduino: The LED is OFF.
```
if the LED is turned off.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59845389-94406300-935d-11e9-8232-4000b9af8d01.jpg"/>

Anytime the Arduino disagrees with the subsystem feedback, the user is notified, an ERROR message is saved in an external log_LED.log file and the LED input is set to the according value.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59845420-a91cf680-935d-11e9-9df6-bac610be8d8e.jpg"/>

Log file:
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59852252-be4e5100-936e-11e9-86eb-d327389ba4a6.JPG"/>

8. To exit the program press ```CTRL+C``` (+ENTER).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/59845518-e41f2a00-935d-11e9-95b7-cf7b989f8c35.jpg"/>

*FINAL REMARKS: This program is protected such that if any undesired input exists, a 'try again' type of notification is printed; The ```ENTER``` command after ```CTRL+c``` is required because there is an existing thread that contains the function ```input()``` that stalls the program. The waiting period is demanded such that existing ```time.sleep()``` functions cease.*

#### ```client_ADB.py```

#####  Hardware setup
Similar to the previous script, the Arduino and ADB subsystem need to be connected after both have been connected to the host computer via the USB ports. The image below shows the necessary wiring. The GND (ground) pins of both boards need to be connected, as well as the pin belonging to the respective power bus of the ADB (U1, U2, U3, or U4) that is selected to be tested with the pin 7 on the Arduino board. As before, if other pin, instead of pin 7, is prefered, the respective pin number has to be modifiued in ```arduino_feedback.ino``` and the software needs to be compiled and uploaded to the Arduino, as explained before. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51790860/60188448-91e37a80-982f-11e9-87b8-08024e5c767d.jpg" width="600"/>

## Results

This project had the purpose to do an integrated test of the Delfi-PQ software. This was partially achieved by testing some subsystems and their response to an external input. The change in state was not only reported by the subsystem itself but by an external board (Arduino) as well. All the tests were successfully demonstrated. 

The LED changed its state according to the user input and this was observed in both boards' feedback. When the Arduino did not detect the correct change, an error was saved in a log file. The ADB subsystem replied in the same way as the LED, because here the alteration was not represented by an LED, but by a power bus. The Arduino succesfully reported correct and incorrect (not demanded or non-existing) state changes.


## Issues encountered

- The connection between LaunchPad and EGSE was not always established. This was noticed several times, mainly after the VirtualBox was initialized. Sometimes the EGSE doesn't show any context menu to choose a port to connect, others it just shows a blank window. The only remedy was to kill the EGSE instance and rerun it until it worked.

- The LaunchPad LED P1.0 GPIO connection burned and the LED was constantly ON when plugged in. This happened suddenly and without any known mistakes (like short circuiting). This was remedied by manually connecting/disconnecting the cable accordingly (or not) to the user input.


## Future changes and recommendations
- The scripts were written to analyse just one possible state change. This could be expanded into analysing a third for state (e.g. a blinking LED) or analysing several subsystems at once. In the latter, the integration testing would be more realistic, comparing it to the final complex system. So, several inputs could be taken into account by the same script and these changes would be reported in a *info* log file, that records every input and output. Any possible errors would be save in a *error* log file (like the one in this project).

- The scripts relied on a rather 'abrupt' way to exit, with the ```CTRL+C``` command. This could be adapted with the UI, by creating an exit command (e.g. with ```0```).

- The user interface that was developed relied on a terminal interaction. There are several GUI libraries available for python that would facilitate the integration testing of the Delfi-PQ software. A GUI would allow to check the Arduino feedback instantly, with a designated button, a simpler user input, and many other useful options that, in the UI, would make the user interaction complex and not efficient. This (future) software would enable a fast test of the subsystems and could even be adapted for future projects.
