# Delfi-PQ - Intergration testing

## Purpose

- receiving feedback from external hardware if the command given to the board was successfully executed
- verification

## Design

so i was thinking of having something that says each 5/10 seconds: The LED is ON (like, if serial reads 1, print this)

if the user sets it to off and it's on, it says: Error, output is not what was chosen. Log file saved; then it saves a file with the time, with what was chosen and what it reads

### Hardware necessary
